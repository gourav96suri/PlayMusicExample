Android App which tells the basics of how to use MediaPlayer (Play, Pause, Replay, Resume, Stop the music).
The Complete App demo video is available on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n44WyrYTs8Y
 If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes.. Happy Coding :)
